# ParidaeReader
This is a text reader. You can put any text files into your phone. Then you can use ParidaeReader to read the articles or sentences for you.

This is a demo version. So it only support put your text file on SD card fixed directory: /paridae/

In the future, I am going to make this folder configurable.

The screen capture is as shown below:
